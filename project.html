<li><h3>Descrition</h3></li>
<p>This app is a scientific calculator that can perform various mathematical operations on Windows. 
It is written in Python using the Tkinter module for creating a graphical user interface. 
The app can compute basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, 
as well as trigonometric functions such as sine, cosine, and tangent. The app also supports constants such as pi and e, 
and can calculate square roots and modulus. 
The app has a user-friendly layout with buttons for each operation and a display for showing the input and output. 
The app can handle both decimal and integer numbers, and can switch between radians and degrees for angle measurements. 
The app is a useful tool for students, teachers, and anyone 
who needs to perform scientific calculations quickly and accurately.</p>
